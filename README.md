# 🐈 Caramel - A Personal Assistant for Neurodivergent Folks

Caramel is a personal assistant that is meant to help neurodivergent people with their daily routines. I wrote Caramel specifically to help me manage my daily tasks, to check in on me and make sure I'm staying on track, and help me manage my time better. It is not meant to be a full-fledged AI assistant, but rather a tool to help me stay organized and focused.

I built Caramel with privacy in mind - it is written to allow you to use your own local LLM provider, so your data stays private and under your control. This project isn't meant for the average layperson to be able to run the software - it requires a decent amount of technical setup, with the expectation being that the bot runs on a server so that you and your community can access it. Feature requests and questions about the product should focus around the specific software and not a community's implementation of it.

I strongly believe in open source code provided freely to my peers. That's why I proudly license all of my software under the [MIT License](LICENSE) 😊.
