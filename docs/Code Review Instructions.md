# Code Review Instructions

## General Guidelines

- Review the codebase to determine if changes align with project architecture and coding standards.
- Check the codebase to determine if any new code that has been added is already implemented somewhere else, or if the codebase can be refactored to make the changes more elegant or simplified.
- Check for adherence to naming conventions, code formatting, and design patterns.
- Ensure that security best practices are followed, especially in authentication and data handling.
- Confirm that performance implications are considered and optimized where necessary.
- Provide constructive feedback and suggest improvements or alternatives when applicable.
